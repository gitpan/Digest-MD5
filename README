This is the Digest-MD5 distribution with shared libraries compiled for
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not
non-CFM 68K versions.

This was compiled with Codewarrior IDE. Passed all tests on PPC and CFM68K.

The original of the changed files are in Mac_changed.sit.

Best installed using cpan-mac, either with the CPAN shell, or the installme
droplet.  From the CPAN shell, type:

    cpan> install K/KI/KIMURA/Digest-MD5-2.13-bin-1-Mac.tgz

#===================================
The Digest::MD5 module allows you to use the RSA Data Security
Inc. MD5 Message Digest algorithm from within Perl programs.  The
algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces as
output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.
MD5 is described in RFC 1321.

You will need perl version 5.004 or better to install this module.
