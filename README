This is the Digest::MD5 module with shared libraries compiled for 
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not 
non-CFM 68K versions.

This was compiled with MPW and Codewarrior.  Passed all tests.  
I have no 68K machine so I can't test the CFM68K version.  Let me 
know of any problems.

Best installed using cpan-mac, either with the CPAN shell,
or the installme droplet.  From the CPAN shell, type:

    cpan> install CNANDOR/Digest-MD5-2.02-bin-1-MacOS.tgz
