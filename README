Digest::MD5
-----------

This is a Perl5 extension interface to the RSA Data Security Inc. MD5
Message Digest algorithm.  We also provide modules to do MD2 and HMAC.

To build the extension, unpack this distribution somewhere, create the
Makefile using 'perl Makefile.PL' and do a 'make', 'make test', and if
successful 'make install'.

You will need perl version 5.004 or better to install this module.
Futher documentation is embedded in the individual modules.
