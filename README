This is the Digest-MD5 distribution with shared libraries compiled for
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not
non-CFM 68K versions.

This was compiled with Codewarrior.  Passed all tests on PPC.
The CFM68K version is not fully tested.  Let me know of any problems.

The original of the changed files are in Mac_changed.sit.
The badfile.t files are changed since MacPerl prepends '# ' to the
exception string (in $@).

The makefiles and source files are in Mac_source_makefile.sit.  Makefiles
are created by MakeMaker and the source files are created by xsubpp_app.
The source files are modified to be build for MacCFM68K. For furthure
information, take a look at Building With Apple MPW -> MacCFM68K of mpxstut

#===================================

Digest::*
---------

This package contains Perl extension interfaces for the following
message digest algorithms:

  - RSA Data Security Inc. MD5   (RFC 1321)
  - RSA Data Security Inc. MD2   (RFC 1319)
  - NIST SHA-1                   (FIPS PUB 180-1)

Modules to calculate HMAC (RFC 2104) digests are also provided.

To build the extensions, unpack this distribution somewhere, create
the Makefile by running 'perl Makefile.PL' and do a 'make', 'make
test', and if successful 'make install'.

You will need perl version 5.004 or better to install these modules.
Further documentation is embedded in the individual modules.
