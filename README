This is the Digest-MD5 distribution with shared libraries compiled for 
MacPerl.  Shared libraries run only on PPC and CFM68K versions, not 
non-CFM 68K versions.

This was compiled with MPW and Codewarrior.  Passed all tests.  
I have no 68K machine so I can't test the CFM68K version.  Let me 
know of any problems.

NOTE: for tests to work properly, the following files need to be
in Unix format (chances are if this was unpacked on a Mac,
they will be in Mac newline format):

   Changes
   MD5.pm
   MD5.xs
   README
   rfc1321.txt

Best installed using cpan-mac, either with the CPAN shell,
or the installme droplet.  From the CPAN shell, type:

    cpan> install CNANDOR/Digest-MD5-2.05-bin-1-Mac.tgz

#===================================

Digest:: MD5, MD2, SHA1, and HMAC
---------------------------------

This is a Perl extension interface to the RSA Data Security Inc. MD5,
MD2, as well as NIST SHA-1, Message Digest algorithms.  This package
also provide modules which calculate HMAC digests.

To build the extensions, unpack this distribution somewhere, create
the Makefile by running 'perl Makefile.PL' and do a 'make', 'make
test', and if successful 'make install'.

You will need perl version 5.004 or better to install these modules.
Further documentation is embedded in the individual modules.
